# Cascade Splits Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**GitHub:** [cascade-protocol/splits](https://github.com/cascade-protocol/splits)
**Target:** Solana payment infrastructure

---

## Overview

Cascade Splits is a non-custodial payment splitting protocol for Solana that automatically distributes incoming payments to multiple recipients based on pre-configured percentages.

**Design Goals:**
- High-throughput micropayments (API calls, streaming payments)
- Minimal compute cost per execution
- Simple, idempotent interface for facilitators
- Permissionless operation

**Key Features:**
- Accept payments to a single vault address
- Automatically split funds to 1-20 recipients
- Mandatory 1% protocol fee (transparent, on-chain enforced)
- Supports SPL Token and Token-2022
- Idempotent execution with self-healing unclaimed recovery
- Multiple configs per authority/mint via unique identifiers
- Integration with x402 payment facilitators

---

## How It Works

### 1. Setup

Authority creates a **split config** defining:
- Token mint (USDC, USDT, etc.)
- Recipients and their percentages (must total 99%)
- Unique identifier (enables multiple configs per authority/mint)

The protocol automatically creates a vault (PDA-owned ATA) to receive payments.

### 2. Payment Flow

```
Payment → Vault (PDA-owned) → execute_split() → Recipients (99%) + Protocol (1%)
```

**Without Facilitator:**
1. Payment sent to vault
2. Anyone calls `execute_split()`
3. Funds distributed

**With x402 Facilitator (e.g., PayAI):**
1. Payment + execute bundled in single transaction
2. Instant atomic distribution
3. User sees automatic split

### 3. Idempotent Execution

`execute_split` is designed to be idempotent and self-healing:
- Multiple calls on the same vault state produce the same result
- Only new funds (vault balance minus unclaimed) are split
- Previously unclaimed amounts are automatically delivered when recipient ATAs become valid
- Facilitators can safely retry without risk of double-distribution

---

## Core Concepts

### PDA Vault Pattern

- Vault is an Associated Token Account owned by a Program Derived Address (PDA)
- No private keys = truly non-custodial
- Funds can only be moved by program instructions

### Self-Healing Unclaimed Recovery

If a recipient's ATA is invalid or missing during execution:
1. Their share is recorded as "unclaimed" and stays in vault
2. Unclaimed funds are protected from re-splitting
3. On subsequent `execute_split` calls, the system automatically attempts to clear unclaimed
4. Once recipient creates their ATA, their funds are delivered on the next execution
5. No separate claim instruction needed - single interface for all operations

Recipients can trigger `execute_split` themselves to retrieve unclaimed funds, even when no new payments exist. This gives recipients agency over their funds without depending on facilitators.

### Protocol Fee

- **Fixed 1%** enforced by program (transparent, cannot be bypassed)
- Recipients control the remaining 99%
- Example: `[90%, 9%]` = 99% total ✅
- Invalid: `[90%, 10%]` = 100% total ❌

**Design Decision:** Fee percentage is hardcoded for transparency. Integrators can verify the exact fee on-chain. If fee changes are needed, protocol will redeploy.

### Multiple Configs per Authority

Each split config includes a `unique_id` allowing an authority to create multiple configurations for the same token:
- Facilitator managing multiple merchants
- Different split ratios for different products
- Parallel config creation without contention

### ATA Lifecycle Strategy

**At config creation:** All recipient ATAs must exist. This:
- Ensures recipients are ready to receive funds
- Protects facilitators from ATA creation costs (0.002 SOL × recipients)
- Prevents malicious configs designed to drain facilitators

**During execution:** Missing ATAs are handled gracefully. If a recipient accidentally closes their ATA:
- Their share goes to unclaimed (protected from re-splitting)
- Other recipients still receive funds
- Funds auto-deliver when ATA is recreated

This design optimizes for both security (creation) and reliability (execution).

## Account Structure

### ProtocolConfig (PDA)

Global protocol configuration (single instance).

```rust
#[account(zero_copy)]
pub struct ProtocolConfig {
    pub authority: Pubkey,       // Can update config
    pub fee_wallet: Pubkey,      // Receives protocol fees
    pub bump: u8,                // Stored for CU optimization
}
```

**Seeds:** `[b"protocol_config"]`

**Usage:** Constraints use `bump = protocol_config.bump` to avoid on-chain PDA derivation.

### SplitConfig (PDA)

Per-split configuration. Uses zero-copy for optimal compute efficiency.

```rust
#[account(zero_copy)]
#[repr(C)]
pub struct SplitConfig {
    pub version: u8,                              // Schema version
    pub authority: Pubkey,                        // Can update/close config
    pub mint: Pubkey,                             // Token mint
    pub vault: Pubkey,                            // Payment destination
    pub unique_id: Pubkey,                        // Enables multiple configs
    pub bump: u8,                                 // Stored for CU optimization
    pub recipient_count: u8,                      // Active recipients (1-20)
    pub recipients: [Recipient; 20],              // Fixed array, use recipient_count
    pub unclaimed_amounts: [UnclaimedAmount; 20], // Fixed array
    pub protocol_unclaimed: u64,                  // Protocol fees awaiting claim
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct Recipient {
    pub address: Pubkey,
    pub percentage_bps: u16,            // 1-9900 (0.01%-99%)
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct UnclaimedAmount {
    pub recipient: Pubkey,
    pub amount: u64,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

**Seeds:** `[b"split_config", authority, mint, unique_id]`

**Space Allocation:** Fixed size for all configs (~1,800 bytes). Zero-copy provides ~50% serialization CU savings, critical for high-throughput micropayments. The fixed rent (~0.015 SOL) is negligible compared to cumulative compute savings.

## Instructions

### initialize_protocol

One-time protocol initialization.

**Authorization:** Deployer (first call only)

**Parameters:**
- `fee_wallet`: Address to receive protocol fees

### update_protocol_config

Updates protocol fee wallet.

**Authorization:** Protocol authority

**Parameters:**
- `new_fee_wallet`: New address for protocol fees

### create_split_config

Creates a new payment split configuration.

**Authorization:** Anyone (becomes authority)

**Validation:**
- 1-20 recipients
- Total exactly 9900 bps (99%)
- No duplicate recipients
- No zero addresses
- No zero percentages
- All recipient ATAs must exist

*Note: Requiring pre-existing ATAs protects payment facilitators from ATA creation costs (0.002 SOL × recipients). Config creators ensure their recipients are ready before setup.*

**Example:**
```typescript
const uniqueId = Keypair.generate().publicKey;

const { splitConfigPDA, vault, signature } = await createSplitConfig({
  authority: merchantKeypair,
  mint: USDC_MINT,
  uniqueId,
  recipients: [
    { address: platform, percentageBps: 900 },   // 9%
    { address: merchant, percentageBps: 9000 },  // 90%
  ],
});

// Store uniqueId for future operations
```

### execute_split

Distributes vault balance to recipients. Self-healing: also clears any pending unclaimed amounts.

**Authorization:** Permissionless (anyone can trigger)

**Required Accounts:**
```typescript
remaining_accounts: [
  recipient_1_ata,    // ATA for first recipient
  recipient_2_ata,    // ATA for second recipient
  // ... one per recipient in config order
  protocol_ata        // Protocol fee wallet ATA (last)
]
```

The instruction validates that `remaining_accounts.len() >= recipient_count + 1`.

**Logic:**
1. Calculate available funds: `vault_balance - total_unclaimed - protocol_unclaimed`
2. If available > 0:
   - Calculate each recipient's share (floor division)
   - Attempt transfer to each recipient
   - If transfer fails → record as unclaimed (protected)
   - Calculate protocol fee (1% + rounding dust)
   - Attempt transfer to protocol
   - If protocol transfer fails → add to `protocol_unclaimed`
3. Attempt to clear all unclaimed amounts:
   - For each recipient entry, check if ATA now exists
   - If valid → transfer exact recorded amount, remove entry
   - If still invalid → keep in unclaimed
4. Attempt to clear protocol unclaimed:
   - If protocol ATA exists → transfer `protocol_unclaimed`, reset to 0
   - No additional fee charged on clearing (fee was calculated on original split)

**Idempotency:** Safe to call multiple times. Only new funds are split. Unclaimed funds cannot be redistributed to other recipients.

**Example Distribution (100 USDC):**
```
Platform (9%):  9.00 USDC
Merchant (90%): 90.00 USDC
Protocol (1%):  1.00 USDC
```

### update_split_config

Authority updates recipient list while preserving the vault address.

**Authorization:** Config authority

**Requirements:**
- Vault must be empty (execute pending splits first)
- 1-20 recipients
- Total exactly 9900 bps (99%)
- No duplicate recipients
- No zero addresses
- No zero percentages
- All recipient ATAs must exist

**Use Case:** The vault address is the stable public interface that payers use. When business arrangements change (new partners, revised percentages), the authority can update the split without requiring payers to change their payment destination.

**Design Decision:** Vault must be empty to ensure funds are always split according to the rules active when they were received.

### close_split_config

Closes config and reclaims rent.

**Authorization:** Config authority

**Requirements:**
- Vault must be empty (all splits executed successfully, no unclaimed amounts remaining)

---

## x402 Integration

### Automatic Detection

x402 facilitators (PayAI, Coinbase CDP) can detect split vaults by checking if payment destination is a token account owned by a SplitConfig PDA:

```typescript
async function detectSplitVault(destination: PublicKey): Promise<SplitConfig | null> {
  const accountInfo = await connection.getAccountInfo(destination);
  if (!accountInfo) return null;

  const tokenAccount = decodeTokenAccount(accountInfo.data);

  try {
    const splitConfig = await program.account.splitConfig.fetch(
      tokenAccount.owner  // PDA that owns the vault
    );

    if (splitConfig.vault.equals(destination)) {
      return splitConfig;
    }
  } catch {
    // Not a split vault
  }

  return null;
}
```

### Atomic Execution

When split vault detected, facilitator bundles:
```typescript
const tx = new Transaction()
  .add(transferInstruction(vault, amount))
  .add(executeSplitInstruction(splitConfigPDA));
```

User signs once → payment + split happen atomically.

### Facilitator Benefits

- **Single interface:** Only `execute_split` needed (self-healing handles unclaimed)
- **Idempotent:** Safe to retry on network failures
- **No ATA creation costs:** Protocol holds funds for missing ATAs, doesn't require facilitator to create them
- **Multiple merchants:** Use `unique_id` to manage many configs with same token

## Token Support

| Token Type | Support | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| SPL Token | ✅ Full | Standard tokens |
| Token-2022 | ✅ Full | All extensions supported |
| Native SOL | ❌ No | Use wrapped SOL |

**Token-2022 Transfer Fees:**
If token has transfer fee extension, recipients receive net amounts after token's fees are deducted. This is separate from the 1% protocol fee.

---

## Events

All operations emit events for indexing:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ProtocolConfigCreated` | Protocol initialized |
| `ProtocolConfigUpdated` | Fee wallet changed |
| `SplitConfigCreated` | New split config created |
| `SplitExecuted` | Payment distributed |
| `RecipientPaymentHeld` | Payment held as unclaimed |
| `SplitConfigUpdated` | Config recipients modified |
| `SplitConfigClosed` | Config deleted, rent reclaimed |

**SplitExecuted Event Details:**
```rust
pub struct SplitExecuted {
    pub config: Pubkey,
    pub vault: Pubkey,
    pub total_amount: u64,              // Total vault balance processed
    pub recipients_distributed: u64,     // Amount sent to recipients
    pub protocol_fee: u64,              // Amount sent to protocol
    pub held_as_unclaimed: u64,         // Amount added to unclaimed
    pub unclaimed_cleared: u64,         // Amount cleared from previous unclaimed
    pub protocol_unclaimed_cleared: u64, // Protocol fees cleared
    pub executor: Pubkey,
    pub timestamp: i64,
}
```

**Use Case:** Build indexer to track all configs, executions, and analytics.

## Security

### Implemented Protections

- ✅ Non-custodial (PDA-owned vaults)
- ✅ Idempotent execution (unclaimed funds protected from re-splitting)
- ✅ Overflow/underflow checks (all math uses `checked_*`)
- ✅ Duplicate recipient validation
- ✅ Bounded account size (max 20 recipients)
- ✅ Protocol fee enforcement (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ Configurable protocol wallet
- ✅ Dynamic space allocation

### Known Limitations

- No pause mechanism (redeploy if critical issue found)
- Single authority per config (use Squads multisig as authority for multi-sig control)
- Unclaimed funds never expire

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Hardcoded 1% fee** | Transparency for integrators. Anyone can verify on-chain. Avoids calculation complexity and potential bugs. Protocol redeploys if fee change needed. |
| **Empty vault for updates** | Ensures funds are split according to rules active when received. Prevents race conditions. |
| **Update preserves vault address** | Vault address is the stable public interface. Payers shouldn't need to update their systems when business arrangements change. |
| **unique_id over counter** | Client generates (no on-chain state management). Enables parallel creation without contention. Simple implementation. |
| **Self-healing over separate claim** | Single idempotent interface for facilitators. Simplifies integration. Recipients auto-receive on next execution. No additional flow to maintain. |
| **Protocol unclaimed tracking** | Enables permissionless support for any token. Protocol doesn't need to pre-create ATAs for every possible token. Fees are preserved until protocol ATA exists. |
| **Zero-copy with fixed arrays** | ~50% serialization CU savings. Fixed rent (~0.015 SOL) is negligible vs cumulative compute savings across thousands of transactions. Critical for high-throughput micropayments. |
| **Stored bumps** | All PDAs store their bump. Constraints use stored bump instead of deriving, saving ~1,300 CU per account validation. |
| **remaining_accounts pattern** | Recipient count is variable (1-20). Anchor requires dynamic account lists via remaining_accounts. Accounts in config order with protocol ATA last. |
| **Minimal logging** | Production builds avoid `msg!` statements. Each costs ~100-200 CU. Debug logging via feature flag. |
| **No streaming/partial splits** | Different product category (see Streamflow, Zebec). Cascade Splits is for instant atomic splits. |
| **No native SOL** | Adds complexity. Use wrapped SOL instead. |
| **No built-in multi-sig** | Use Squads/Realms as authority. Works with current design without added complexity. |
| **Pre-existing ATAs required** | Protects facilitators from being drained by forced ATA creation (0.002 SOL each). Config creators responsible for recipient readiness. |

## Technical Details

**Dependencies:**
```toml
anchor-lang = "0.32.1"
anchor-spl = "0.32.1"
```

**Constants:**
```rust
PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS: u16 = 100;       // 1%
REQUIRED_SPLIT_TOTAL: u16 = 9900;  // Recipients must total 99%
MIN_RECIPIENTS: usize = 1;
MAX_RECIPIENTS: usize = 20;
```

**Fixed Space (Zero-Copy):**
```rust
// SplitConfig size (fixed for all configs)
pub const SPLIT_CONFIG_SIZE: usize =
    8 +                     // discriminator
    1 +                     // version
    32 +                    // authority
    32 +                    // mint
    32 +                    // vault
    32 +                    // unique_id
    1 +                     // bump
    1 +                     // recipient_count
    (34 * 20) +             // recipients [Recipient; 20]
    (48 * 20) +             // unclaimed_amounts [UnclaimedAmount; 20]
    8;                      // protocol_unclaimed
    // Total: ~1,787 bytes
```

**Compute Budget:**
For high-throughput micropayments, set explicit CU limits to minimize priority fees:
```typescript
transaction.add(
  ComputeBudgetProgram.setComputeUnitLimit({
    units: 50000  // Adjust based on recipient count
  })
);
```

**Logging:**
Production builds use minimal logging to save compute. Debug logging available via feature flag:
```rust
#[cfg(feature = "verbose")]
msg!("Debug: {}", value);
```

**Program ID:** `[To be updated after deployment]`
